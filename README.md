+ It is a very interesting iOS app created from scratch 
    - My primary focus was implementing the backend
        - I implemented the backend for the following features:
        - User
            - signup
            - verify (customized email verification)
            - login 
            - logout
            - user only signs up with EDU email
            - user needs to Verify registration via email
            - admin role
            - user role
        - Hackathon
            - create hacks
            - delete hacks
            - fetch hacks
        - Group
            - create group
            - display group
            - remove group
        - Messages
            - create messages (dynamically)
            - fetch messages
        - Email Confirmation
            - user receives a URL that contains a user specific token
            which is checked against the token stored in the database.
            A successful registration requires tokens to match.

+ Tech
    - PHP (Database connection, creating tables, ...)
    - MySQL (User specific details including Photos)

+ Extremely proud of completing this project. Frontend was briliantly put 
together by an experienced team member who provided me with guidance in tough times.
I started without knowing what 'backend' meant let alone PHP or MySQL, but certainly walked 
away with some good ideas in mind.
